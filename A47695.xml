            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The happy conjuncture of both theſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Triumph and Ioy of your Sacred pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, extracted from the different and divided diſpoſitions and opinions, gives us cauſe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve &amp; to admire theſe bleſſed effects from ſuch contrary cauſes.

            <p>The Story of theſe times will ſeeme para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes in following generations, when they ſhall heare of Peace ſprung from the Root of diſſention, of union planted upon the Stocke of

            <p>Nothing can reduce theſe truths into a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, but the knowledge of your piety and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, who hath accompliſht theſe acts of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by goodneſſe, and gentleneſſe, without force and violence.</p>
            <p>This way of conqueſt, this <hi>bellum incruentum,</hi> hath beene the Rule of the moſt valiant and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſant Monarchs, advancing your glory, in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of one ſubject, more then in the death of a thouſand enemies.</p>

            <p>Now though I have deceived you a little of your expectation in point of time, I confeſſe you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived my expectation in finding of buſineſſe here; for I had thought to have found things in quietneſſe, and ſettled both for Religion and peace of this Kingdome,

            <p>Now I aſſure you, I come with the ſame affection that you or any good people of the world could wiſh, for I am ſo farre from diſliking any thing that I have done hitherto, that if it were to doe againe (in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and good of my people) that I proteſt I would doe it againe.</p>
            <p>And whatſoever may be juſtly expected of me for the ſecuring of Religion and Liberty of my people, I ſhall not faile to doe it, and therefore I ſhall mention no particular at this time, but onely that great particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which Mr. Speaker did mention, of which I do not doubt, but you have had a great care, yet me thinks, things go on ſlowly; and I mention this more reaſonably, becauſe a couple of Noblemen are come out of <hi>Scotland</hi> according to the Petition and Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which it pleaſed both Houſes to ſend unto mee at <hi>Barwicke,</hi> which I inſtantly diſpatched to the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, who now have the diſpoſing of all things.
